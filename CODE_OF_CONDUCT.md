# prompt: This is a clean and complete implementation of the Contributor Covenant v2.1, which is widely recognized and respected in open source communities. It provides a solid foundation for building a welcoming and inclusive project culture.
# Here’s a quick review + enhancement guide:
# ⸻
# What You’re Doing Well
# 	•	Full version coverage (v2.1) with enforcement, scope, guidelines, and attribution.
# 	•	Balanced tone between positive engagement and clear consequences for harmful behavior.
# 	•	Defined enforcement tiers (Correction → Warning → Temporary → Permanent Ban), ensuring predictability and fairness.
# 	•	Global scope ensures coverage for both public and private contexts, critical in distributed/open-source teams.
# ⸻
# Optional Enhancements (Perks)
# 1. Project-Specific Contact Info
# Instead of the placeholder:
# Instances of abusive ... may be reported to: opensource@github.com
# Customize with:
# 	•	A dedicated project email (e.g., conduct@yourproject.org)
# 	•	A GitHub team handle (e.g., @your-org/conduct-team)
# 	•	A form (e.g., anonymous Google Form or Typeform)
# 2. Clarify “Community Spaces”
# You could define:
# 	•	GitHub issues, discussions, pull requests
# 	•	Project Discord/Slack
# 	•	Live events or livestreams
# This improves clarity and accountability.
# 3. Add a Shorter “TL;DR” at Top
# For casual readers or contributors:
# > **TL;DR:** Be kind. No harassment, trolling, or abuse. Respect differences. Violations may lead to bans.
# 4. Link from README.md
# Make it visible:
# [![Code of Conduct](https://img.shields.io/badge/conduct-Contributor%20Covenant-4baaaa.svg)](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
# ⸻
# Would you like me to generate a project-specific version of this Code of Conduct, with:
# 	•	Your project name
# 	•	Customized enforcement contact
# 	•	Contributor expectations tailored to your repo structure (e.g., symbolic contributions, language generation, tooling behavior)?
# Just provide the details and I’ll generate it for you.

# No code changes needed.  The provided code is already a complete and functional
# implementation that generates a Venn diagram based on sample data.  If you want
# to change the data, replace the existing "data" dictionary with your own.
# No modifications are required to execute the code as is.
